_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Attempts to connect to the given host and establish itself as a
     worker process.  This function is called automatically when worker
     processes are spawned by the main process.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     StartWorker(host = "localhost", port=32000, retries=2, sleeptime=1, quiet=TRUE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    host: name of the machine that the main/controller process is on 

    port: the (TCP/IP) port number to connect to 

 retries: the number of times to retry making the connection 

sleeptime: how long (in seconds) to sleep between connection tries 

   quiet: should the worker process supress most logging messages? 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The only time a user should call this function is when they
     started the parallel engine on the main process using the
     spawn=FALSE option to StartPE.  In that case, the main process
     will block waiting for the worker processes to connect.  The user
     must run the appropriate number of worker processes and have them
     call this function.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'StartPE'  For enabling the parallel engine. 'PE'        For
     running parallel jobs. 'POBJ'  For returning background jobs to
     the main process.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     ## Not run: 
     # If you have MPI running
     StartPE(2)

     x = matrix(rnorm(128 * 128), 128, 128)

     PE( a <- svd(x) )
     PE( b <- solve(x) )
     PE( y <- b %*% a$u )
     POBJ( y )
     str(y)
     StopPE()
     ## End(Not run)
