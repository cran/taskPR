<h2>Parallel Execute</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Attempts to execute the given expression through the parallel engine.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
PE(x, global=FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
expression to execute in background/parallel </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>global</code></td>
<td>
should this command be executed globally? </td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The parallel engine takes the given expression and tries to execute it
on a worker process (which may be on a remote system).  It will be
executed in the background and possibly in parallel with other PE calls.
</p>
<p>
Only a limited number of jobs can be run through the parallel engine at
once.  If that number is exceeded, then the PE call will block until some
of the jobs have finished.
</p>
<p>
<EM>The given expression <STRONG>must</STRONG> be of the form "out &lt;- f(...)".</EM>
</p>
<p>
When code{global} is true, the command is executed globally.  This does
several things.  First, the parallel engine will wait until all workers
are free before started to execute the command.  Second, the command will
be executed on all worker processes simultaneously.  Third, the output of
the command will NOT be deleted from the worker processes' workspaces (as
is usually done).  This "global execute" functionality is designed for
loading libraries or defining functions, and not for the parallel
execution of common commands.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
## Not run: 
# If you have MPI running
StartPE(2)

x = matrix(rnorm(128 * 128), 128, 128)

PE( a &lt;- svd(x) )
PE( b &lt;- solve(x) )
PE( y &lt;- b %*% a$u )
POBJ( y )
str(y)
StopPE()
## End(Not run)
